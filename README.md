# YouTube-SearchAPI
Uses a YouTube API key to search for specific details on videos.
## Issues
I struggled with some of the documentation that you are supposed to use while working with APIs.
I accidentally made the .env file a .py file thinking it could be all in 1 file. It might've been possible to do this, but I really didn't want to try to figure it out this way.
I ran into an issue with my API key not loading. I also ran into a different issue with there being no results found when searching. 
Both of the issues above were resolved by enabling my API key and fixing some of the code that I had put in. For some reason when you recieve your YouTube API key it can be disabled, so I just had to go into Google Cloud Console and quickly enable it. I accidentally messed up when I tried to change the way I wanted my Lab to be layed out. I switched to having 3 different .py files for my code, and when doing this I put in the wrong documentation into the .env file and the youtube_search.py file when transferring the API key between the two. 
Aside from the couple challenges above, this lab actually wasn't too bad. I enjoyed the freedom of it, and I do think this is something I could comeback to and expand more on a less busy time in my life.
